# Danbooru-Downloader
This is a public version of my danbooru downloader as requested by some users on r/Astolfo. Please open this file in a python IDE and read the comments in the file! Feel free to send me issue reports, improvements or bug fix requests. Cheers!

This is optional, but I would really appreciate that if you reuse parts of my code or modify and re-release it that you please credit me by linking back to this repo. :)
